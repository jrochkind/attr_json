For Rails 5.0, 5.1, or 5.2. Typed and cast like Active Record. Supporting nested models,
dirty tracking, some querying (with postgres jsonb contains), and working smoothy with form builders.

Use your database as a typed object store via ActiveRecord, in the same models right next to
ordinary ActiveRecord column-backed attributes and associations. Your json-serialized attr_json
attributes use as much of the existing ActiveRecord architecture as we can.}
